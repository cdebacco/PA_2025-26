### Learning Objectives
At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Analyse** a problem where the underlying variables are random and possibly driven or connected by stochastic processes
2. **Identify** the correct mathematical rules governing real-world and measured data that is inherently stochastic in nature
3. **Apply** mathematical techniques for handling random variables on networks, such as probabilistic methods, stochastic processes and graph theory


### Prerequisites
- Basic probability
- Basic linear algebra
